Go back to Heather's video and see if we can get more tips like:

1.) Identify your audience
2.) Create a powerful first sentence (prove a pain point)
3.) Tell a compelling story
4.) Call to action
5.) End with personality 


1.) One must have audience in mind prior to creating a bio, and tailor the bio to best fit the audience. This helps capturing audience's attention. It is fine to have different iterations of a bio. 

2.) Heather concisely elaborates 3 steps to creating a powerful introduction to the bio. The outline is a concise way to prove a pain point and stand out. 
  A.) Who you are
  B.) What your audience can expect from you
  C.) How you are going to help them 

3.) Paint a short narrative about the things that make you unique (Ex. your professional background, education, skills etc...)
