Go back to Heather's video and see if we can get more tips like:

1.) Identify your audience
2.) Create a powerful first sentence (prove a pain point)
3.) Tell a compelling story

Hi, my name is Sharon Nguyen. I have 6-7 years of healthcare experience as a Certified Nurse Assistant, and am currently transitioning out of healthcare into software development. I made this tough decision to sacrifice my current career to transition into the tech industry due to burn out during COVID-19, and because I saw how important software/programming tools have within the health realm. 

I hope to merge my interpersonal skills, mission-driven passion for accessible healthcare, and patient advocacy into an app developer. It is my ultimate goal to create an app like Door Dash, that can help end period poverty by providing hygeine products to under-served communities. If you would like to learn more about my journey with Year Up as an emerging professional, i can be found on LinkedIn and Github.
